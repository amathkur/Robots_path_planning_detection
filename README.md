# Robots_path_planning_detection
This repository provides path planning and obstacle detection tools for autonomous robots. It includes algorithms like A*, Dijkstra, and RRT, along with obstacle detection using sensors (LIDAR, cameras). The project supports simulations, real-time navigation, and machine learning for dynamic path optimization.
