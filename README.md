Repository: Robots Path Planning and Detection

This repository offers a comprehensive suite of tools for autonomous robots focused on efficient path planning and obstacle detection. It includes several well-established algorithms, such as A*, Dijkstra, and Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT), for optimal pathfinding in complex environments. The repository also features advanced obstacle detection capabilities, utilizing sensors like LIDAR and cameras to identify and classify obstacles, allowing for safe and reliable navigation.

Key features:

    Path Planning Algorithms: Implementations of A*, Dijkstra, and RRT to find optimal or safe paths based on the environment.
    Obstacle Detection: Uses real-time sensor data (LIDAR, cameras) and computer vision techniques to detect and avoid obstacles in the robot’s path.
    Simulations: Virtual environments to simulate and test the robot’s navigation, ensuring robust performance before deployment.
    Real-Time Navigation: Designed to deploy on real-world robotic platforms for live pathfinding and obstacle avoidance.
    Machine Learning Integration: Includes options for dynamic path optimization using machine learning techniques, allowing robots to adapt to changing environments and improve over time.

Additionally, we have developed a robotic arm integrated with path planning capabilities to perform complex tasks like object manipulation and precise movements. This arm robot is a key feature of the project, demonstrating how path planning can extend to more intricate robot functions.

The repository also provides detailed setup instructions, configuration guidelines, and usage examples in the README to help developers get started quickly. Contributions, bug reports, and feature requests are encouraged to improve and extend the capabilities of the project.
